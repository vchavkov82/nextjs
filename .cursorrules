# Cursor Rules for BA Development

## Environment
- **OS**: OpenSUSE
- **Container Runtime**: Podman (NOT Docker)
- **Compose Command**: Always use `podman compose` (never `docker-compose` or `docker compose`)

## Container Commands
When working with containers or compose files:
- ✅ Use: `podman compose up`, `podman compose down`, `podman compose ps`, `podman compose exec`
- ❌ Never use: `docker-compose`, `docker compose`, or any docker commands

## Script Management
- Scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory
- **IMPORTANT**: If you create a new script in a feature branch, you MUST also commit it to the `develop` branch
- The user regularly rebases `develop` into feature branches, so scripts need to exist in `develop` to avoid conflicts

## Development Workflow
- When creating scripts, ensure they use `podman compose` instead of `docker-compose`
- All container-related operations should use Podman
- Scripts should handle Podman rootless mode warnings gracefully (filter out UID warnings)

## Example Script Pattern
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Use podman compose
podman compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Filter out harmless Podman rootless warnings
podman compose ps 2>&1 | grep -vE '(cannot set uid|effective uid.*Operation not permitted|^--:)'
```
