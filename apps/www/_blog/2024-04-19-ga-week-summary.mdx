There's always a lot to cover in Launch Weeks. Here are a few highlights:

### #10: Bootstrap: the fastest way to launch a project

BA Bootstrap is the fastest way to spin up a new hosted BA project from existing starter templates. Just run `supabase bootstrap` with our CLI and we'll help you launch a new application and attach a remote database to get you started.

### #9: Branching is now Publicly available

BA Branching is now in open beta. You can enable it on any project that's Pro Plan or above. Branching is a seamless integration of Git with your development workflow, extending beyond your local environment to a remote database.

### #8: Postgres Index Advisor

We shipped a Postgres extension for recommending indexes to improve query performance. It leans heavily on [HypoPG](https://github.com/HypoPG/hypopg), an excellent extension to determine if Postgres will use a given index without spending resources to create them.

### #7: Official Swift support

The BA Swift libraries are now officially supported by BA. This makes it simple to interact with BA from applications on Apple's platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.

### #6: Security Advisor + Performance Advisor

We're dropping some handy tools in BA Studio this week to help with security and performance: a **Security Advisor** for detecting insecure database configuration, and a **Performance Advisor** for suggesting database optimizations.

### #5: Native AI support in Edge Functions

We're making it super easy to run AI models within BA Edge Functions. We have a new API to generate embeddings and upcoming support for Large Language Models like `llama3` and `mistral`.

### #4: S3 compatibility in BA Storage

BA Storage is now officially an S3-Compatible Storage Provider. With the support of the S3 protocol, you can now connect BA Storage to thousands of 3rd-party tools and services, and make it even easier to use BA for data engineering.

### #3: Anonymous sign-ins

Anonymous sign-ins can be used to create **temporary users** who haven't signed up for your application yet. This lowers the friction for new users to try out your product since they don't have to provide any signup credentials. One of our [most-requested features](https://github.com/supabase/auth/issues/68) by the community!

### #2: Oriole joins BA

[Oriole](https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb) is a table storage extension for Postgres. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Postgres' existing storage engine, and benchmarks show that it's significantly faster. Over time we hope that it can become available for any Postgres installation and we will continue to work with Oriole and the Postgres community to make this happen.

### #1: General Availability

BA is now GA. During the first year of BA we set ourselves a goal: build a managed platform capable of securely running 1 million databases. Today we've proven that metric and we're announcing the General Availability of the platform that will serve the next 99 million.

## More updates

There's been a few other highlights this week:

### BA + Fly updates

In the previous Launch Week we started working on [Fly Postgres, a managed offering from BA](https://www.assistance.bg/blog/postgres-on-fly-by-supabase). We've received a lot of feedback from early testers, and we're working hard to make the service available and as resilient for production workloads.

Today we're opening up access to everyone **for testing**. Testers can also try [Branching](/docs/guides/platform/branching), an opt-in feature which creates an ephemeral test environment for your git branches. These instances automatically pause when you aren't using them.

<Admonition type="note" label="Testing only">

The service is in public alpha. We don't recommend using it for production.

</Admonition>

### Meetups in 27 cities

We started GA Week with 10 confirmed community meetups. Over the week, more community members volunteered to host meetups in their own cities. With 25 meetups across the world, some with just 3 people and some with over 50, the BA community has truly made our team feel thankful. A huges shout out to these organizers:

Rita & Ann (New York), Mansueli & Guilherme (Maringá), Florian (Seoul), Jose & Aile (Miami), Philippe (Berlin), Tyler (Tokyo), Ivan (Tenerife), Thor (Singapore), Jack (London), Fatuma (Nairobi), Emilio (Milan), Jay Raj Mishra (Kathmandu), Bharat (New Delhi), Abdulhakeem Adams (Ilorin, Nigeria), Kyle Rummens (Utah, USA), Laksh (Nagpur, India), Cam Blackwood (Edinburgh, Scotland), Harry (Central Manchester), Guilleume (Dubai), Kristian (Bergen, Norway), Andrei (Zagreb, Croatia), Misel (Serbia), Matthew (Toronto, Canada), Charlie Coppinger (Wellington, NZ), Nicolas Montone (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Ryan Griffin (Melbourne, Australia), Isheanesu (Cape Town, SA), Aileen (Monterrey, Mexico), Martin (Hong Kong), Bilal Aamer (Hyderabad, India), Gabriel Pan Gantes (Barcelona, Spain).

### Upcoming Meetup in SF

We're also hosting a bigger meeting in San Fransisco in June, with a few friends like [Fly.io](http://Fly.io), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/). If you want to hang out with Ant & I, sign up for a full day of hacking at the a16z office:
