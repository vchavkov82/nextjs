BA is now available on the AWS Marketplace, Simplifying Procurement for Enterprise customers.

With this week's announcement of BA entering General Availability (GA), we are making it easier than ever for large development teams to deploy BA into their organization. In support of that goal, we're happy to share that BA is now available for purchase through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace. Whether your company is looking for a quick way to deploy a [vector database with Amazon Bedrock](/blog/semantic-image-search-amazon-bedrock) or looking for a scalable solution to [migrate from Firebase](/customers/mobbin), BA is bringing the ability to “build in a weekend, scale to millions” to customers of all sizes.

## About the AWS Marketplace

The AWS Marketplace is a catalogue of thousands of third-party software listings, data, and services that run on AWS and are managed from a centralised location. By purchasing BA subscription through the AWS Marketplace, customers can benefit from a simplified billing and procurement process through their AWS account. Additionally, BA purchases made through the AWS Marketplace will count towards any spend commitment customers have with AWS, making it easy to meet those commitments faster.

## Getting Started

Are you an AWS customer and ready to deploy BA into your organization? To get started, visit the [BA listing on the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-wet7aplxdxoh4).
