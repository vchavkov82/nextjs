Self-hosted CI/CD Runners allow you to run your CI/CD workflows on your own infrastructure, providing better performance, cost savings, and control over your build environment.

## Overview

Self-hosted CI/CD Runners enable you to execute your GitHub Actions workflows (and other CI/CD platforms) on your own infrastructure. This gives you:

- **Cost savings**: Run CI/CD jobs at a fraction of the cost of hosted runners
- **Performance**: Customize runner instances to match your workload requirements
- **Control**: Full control over the build environment, dependencies, and security
- **Flexibility**: Support for Linux, Windows, macOS, and GPU runners
- **Scalability**: Scale runners based on your workload needs

## Runner Types

Self-hosted CI/CD Runners support multiple runner types:

- **Linux**: Native x64 and arm64 architectures
- **Windows**: Full Windows Server support
- **macOS**: Custom macOS runners
- **GPU**: NVIDIA and AMD GPU support for ML workloads
- **Pools**: Warm pools for faster job startup times

## Key Features

- Multiple runner types (Linux, Windows, macOS, GPU)
- Warm pools for reduced queuing times
- Caching strategies for faster builds
- Custom images and configurations
- Networking and security controls
- Monitoring and cost reporting
- Integration with security tools
- Container builds with native Intel and Arm support
- Remote caching for build tools (Bazel, Go, Gradle, Turborepo, sccache, Pants)
- High-performance compute with faster CPUs and networking

## Performance Benefits

Self-hosted CI/CD Runners provide significant performance improvements:

- **30% faster CPUs**: Advanced compute instances for faster builds
- **10x faster networking**: Optimized network throughput for cache and artifact transfers
- **10x faster cache throughput**: High-performance distributed caching
- **Unrestricted concurrency**: Run multiple jobs in parallel without limits
- **50% lower cost**: More cost-effective than hosted runners
