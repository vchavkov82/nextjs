title: Deployment & Branching
---

Deploying your app makes it live and accessible to users. Usually, you deploy an app to at least two environments: a production environment for users and (one or multiple) staging or preview environments for developers.

BA provides several options for environment management and deployment.

## Environment management

You can maintain separate development, staging, and production environments for BA:

- **Development**: Develop with a local BA stack using the [BA CLI](/docs/guides/local-development).
- **Staging**: Use [branching](/docs/guides/deployment/branching) to create staging or preview environments. You can use persistent branches for a long-lived staging setup, or ephemeral branches for short-lived previews (which are often tied to a pull request).
- **Production**: If you have branching enabled, you can use the BA GitHub integration to automatically push your migration files when you merge a pull request. Alternatively, you can set up your own continuous deployment pipeline using the BA CLI.

## Deployment

You can automate deployments using:

- The [BA GitHub integration](/dashboard/project/_/settings/integrations) (with branching enabled)
- The [BA CLI](/docs/guides/local-development) in your own continuous deployment pipeline
- The [BA Terraform provider](/docs/guides/deployment/terraform)
