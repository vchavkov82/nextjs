## Get started

The fastest and recommended way to self-host BA is using Docker.

<div className="grid md:grid-cols-12 gap-4 not-prose">
  <div className="md:col-span-6 xl:col-span-4 relative" key="/guides/self-hosting/docker">
    <Link href="/guides/self-hosting/docker" passHref>
      <GlassPanel icon={'/docs/img/icons/docker'} hasLightIcon={true}
        title={
            <span className="flex items-center gap-2">
              Docker
              <Badge variant="success">Official</Badge>
            </span>
          }
        showIconBg={true}
      >
      Deploy BA within your own infrastructure using Docker Compose.
      </GlassPanel>
    </Link>

## Other deployment options

{/* supa-mdx-lint-disable-next-line Rule004ExcludeWords */}
There are several other ways to deploy BA with the help of community-driven projects. These projects may be outdated and are seeking active maintainers. If you're interested in maintaining one of these projects, [contact the Community team](/open-source/contributing/supasquad).

<div className="grid md:grid-cols-12 gap-4 not-prose">
  {[
    {
      name: 'Kubernetes',
      description: 'Helm charts to deploy a BA on Kubernetes.',
      href: 'https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-kubernetes',
    },
    {
      name: 'Traefik',
      description: 'A self-hosted BA setup with Traefik as a reverse proxy.',
      href: 'https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-traefik',
    },
  ].map((x) => (
    <div className="md:col-span-6 xl:col-span-3" key={x.href}>
      <Link href={x.href} passHref>
        <GlassPanel
          title={
            <span className="flex items-center gap-2">
              {x.name}
                  <Badge>Maintainer needed</Badge>
            </span>
          }
        >
          {x.description}
        </GlassPanel>
      </Link>
    </div>

))}

## About self-hosting

Self-hosting is a good fit if you need full control over your data, have compliance requirements that prevent using managed services, or want to run BA in an isolated environment.

### How self-hosted BA differs

Self-hosted BA is different from:

- **BA CLI** (local development), which is intended for development and testing only.
- **Managed BA** platform, which is fully hosted and operated by BA.

### Telemetry

Self-hosted BA does not phone home or collect any telemetry.

### Your responsibilities when self-hosting

When you self-host, **you are responsible for**:

- Server provisioning and maintenance
- Security hardening and keeping OS and services updated
- Maintaining the Postgres database
- Backups and disaster recovery
- Monitoring and uptime
