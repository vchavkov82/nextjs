Learn how to use runner warm pools to get <10s queuing time for your CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

Runner pools maintain warm runners ready to execute jobs, reducing queuing time and improving workflow performance.

## Benefits

Runner pools provide:

- **Fast startup**: Warm runners start jobs immediately
- **Cost optimization**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale based on queue depth
- **Load balancing**: Distribute jobs across runners

## Configuration

Configure runner pools with:

- Minimum and maximum pool sizes
- Scaling policies
- Instance types
- Auto-scaling rules

## Setup

Create a runner pool:

```yaml
# Pool configuration example
pool:
  name: production-pool
  min_size: 2
  max_size: 10
  instance_type: medium
```

## Auto-Scaling

Runner pools support auto-scaling:

- Scale up when queue depth increases
- Scale down when idle
- Configure scaling thresholds
- Set cooldown periods

## Best Practices

- Size pools based on workload patterns
- Use warm pools for critical workflows
- Monitor pool utilization
- Adjust scaling policies based on metrics
