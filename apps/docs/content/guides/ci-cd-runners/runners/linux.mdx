Learn how to set up and use Linux self-hosted runners for your CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

Linux runners support native x64 and arm64 architectures and provide a flexible environment for Linux-based builds and tests.

## Supported Architectures

- **x64**: 64-bit x86 architecture (amd64)
- **arm64**: 64-bit ARM architecture (aarch64)

## Supported Distributions

Linux runners can use various Linux distributions:

- Ubuntu (LTS versions)
- Amazon Linux
- Debian
- Custom distributions

## Setup

Configure Linux runners in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted-linux
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: ./build.sh
```

## Docker Support

Linux runners support Docker and containerized workloads:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
    with:
      context: .
      push: false
```

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate instance types for your workload
- Enable caching for faster builds
- Use Docker for consistent environments
- Monitor resource utilization
