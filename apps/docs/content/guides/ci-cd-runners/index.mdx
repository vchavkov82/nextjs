Remote Docker image building that's up to 40x faster than local or CI provider builds.

## What is CI/CD Runners?

CI/CD Runners provides remote Docker image building as a drop-in replacement for `docker build`. The service runs optimized BuildKit on remote builder infrastructure, eliminating the need to manage layer caches manually.

### Key Features

- **Up to 40x faster builds** through optimized remote infrastructure
- **Native multi-platform support** for x86 and ARM architectures without emulation
- **Persistent layer caching** automatically shared across team members
- **High-performance builders** with 16 CPUs and 32GB RAM by default
- **Seamless CI/CD integration** with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and more
- **Security isolation** for fork builds prevents cache poisoning

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
curl https://cli.depot.dev/install.sh | sh

# Build a Docker image
depot build -t myapp:latest .

# Multi-platform build
depot build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t myapp:latest .

# Push to registry
depot build -t myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:latest --push .
```
