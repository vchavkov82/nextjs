Create GitHub Actions workflows using CI/CD Runners.

## Overview

GitHub Actions workflows use YAML syntax to define CI/CD pipelines. CI/CD Runners can execute these workflows, providing self-hosted infrastructure for your builds and tests.

## Basic Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build
        run: echo "Building application"
      - name: Test
        run: echo "Running tests"
```

## Using Specific Runners

Target specific runners using labels:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, docker]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker build -t myapp .
```

## Matrix Builds

Run jobs across multiple configurations:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

## Caching

Cache dependencies for faster builds:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

## Artifacts

Upload and download artifacts:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: ./build.sh
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist/
          retention-days: 7

  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Environment Variables

Use environment variables:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production
      BUILD_VERSION: ${{ github.sha }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building version $BUILD_VERSION"
```

## Secrets

Use GitHub secrets securely:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Conditional Execution

Run jobs and steps conditionally:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh

  test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: npm test
      - name: Upload coverage
        if: success()
        run: ./upload-coverage.sh
```

## Workflow Triggers

Configure workflow triggers:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
```

## Best Practices

- Use `self-hosted` label for CI/CD Runners
- Label runners appropriately for job routing
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Use artifacts to share build outputs between jobs
- Store secrets in GitHub secrets management
- Use conditional execution for efficiency
- Document workflow purpose and requirements
- Use matrix builds for multi-platform testing

## Advanced Features

### Reusable Workflows

Create reusable workflows:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable-build.yml
name: Reusable Build

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
```

### Workflow Status Badges

Add workflow status badges to your README:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Workflows not running**: Check workflow syntax and triggers
- **Runner not found**: Verify runner labels match workflow requirements
- **Cache not working**: Check cache keys and paths
- **Artifacts missing**: Verify artifact paths and permissions
- **Secrets not available**: Verify secrets are configured in GitHub
