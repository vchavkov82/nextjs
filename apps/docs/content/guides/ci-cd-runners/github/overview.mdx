- **Flexibility**: Support for custom images and configurations

## Quick Start

Get started with GitHub Actions on CI/CD Runners:

1. [Set up self-hosted runners](/guides/ci-cd-runners/github/setup) for your GitHub repositories
2. [Configure runners](/guides/ci-cd-runners/github/runner-configuration) for your workflows
3. [Create GitHub Actions workflows](/guides/ci-cd-runners/github/workflows) to use your runners

## Use Cases

CI/CD Runners with GitHub Actions are ideal for:

- Organizations requiring dedicated runners for all repositories
- Repositories with specific dependencies or requirements
- Large teams with high CI/CD workload
- Sensitive projects requiring private infrastructure
- Cost optimization for high-volume CI/CD usage
- Custom build environments and configurations

## Runner Types

CI/CD Runners support various runner configurations:

- **Repository runners**: Runners scoped to a single repository
- **Organization runners**: Runners available to all repositories in an organization
- **Enterprise runners**: Runners available across an enterprise
