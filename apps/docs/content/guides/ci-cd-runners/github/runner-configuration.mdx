title: 'Runner Configuration'

Configure CI/CD Runners for GitHub Actions workflows.

## Overview

Configure runners for optimal performance with GitHub Actions workflows, including labels, environments, and resource allocation.

## Runner Labels

Use labels to target specific runners:

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO --token YOUR_TOKEN --labels "self-hosted,linux,docker,gpu"
```

Use labels in workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, docker]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker build -t myapp .
```

## Runner Groups

Organize runners into groups (organization/enterprise only):

1. Go to **Settings > Actions > Runner groups**
2. Create a new runner group
3. Add runners to the group
4. Assign runner groups to repositories

## Environment Variables

Set environment variables for runners:

```bash
# Set in runner configuration
export CUSTOM_VAR="value"

# Or in .env file in runner directory
echo "CUSTOM_VAR=value" >> .env
```

Use in workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    env:
      CUSTOM_VAR: ${{ env.CUSTOM_VAR }}
    steps:
      - run: echo $CUSTOM_VAR
```

## Runner Resources

Configure runner resources:

- **CPU**: Specify CPU requirements and limits
- **Memory**: Set memory limits for jobs
- **Storage**: Configure disk space and cleanup
- **Network**: Set network bandwidth and access

## Runner Scaling

Scale runners based on workload:

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scale runners based on queue depth
- **Manual scaling**: Manually adjust runner count
- **Scheduled scaling**: Scale runners on a schedule
- **Event-driven scaling**: Scale based on repository events

## Security Configuration

Configure runner security:

- **Runner tokens**: Use secure tokens for authentication
- **Network isolation**: Isolate runners from sensitive networks
- **Access control**: Limit runner access to specific repositories
- **Secret management**: Securely manage GitHub secrets
- **Runner updates**: Keep runners updated for security patches

## Runner Maintenance

Maintain runners for reliability:

- **Update runners**: Regularly update to the latest version
- **Monitor logs**: Check runner logs for issues
- **Clean up**: Remove unused runners
- **Health checks**: Monitor runner health and availability
- **Backup configuration**: Backup runner configurations

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate labels for job routing
- Organize runners into logical groups
- Set appropriate resource limits
- Monitor runner performance and utilization
- Keep runners updated
- Document runner configurations
- Use separate runners for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Label mismatches**: Verify labels match workflow requirements
- **Resource constraints**: Check CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Network issues**: Verify network connectivity to GitHub
- **Authentication errors**: Check runner tokens and permissions
- **Runner offline**: Check runner service status and logs
