Learn how to set up self-hosted GitHub Actions runners with CI/CD Runners.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up GitHub Actions runners:

- GitHub repository, organization, or enterprise account
- CI/CD Runners infrastructure configured
- Access to GitHub for runner registration
- Appropriate permissions to add runners

## Install GitHub Actions Runner

Download and install the GitHub Actions Runner:

### Linux

```bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner

# Download the latest runner package
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz

# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz
```

### macOS

```bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner

# Download the latest runner package
curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz

# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner; cd actions-runner

# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip

# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem; [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD/actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip", "$PWD")
```

## Configure Runner

Configure the runner for your repository, organization, or enterprise:

### Repository Runner

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Organization Runner

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/OWNER --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Enterprise Runner

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/enterprises/ENTERPRISE --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Enter the runner group (if applicable)
2. Enter the name of the runner
3. Enter labels (optional)
4. Enter the work folder (default: `_work`)

## Install Runner as Service

Install and start the runner as a service:

### Linux (systemd)

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

### macOS (launchd)

```bash
./svc.sh install
./svc.sh start
```

### Windows (NSSM)

```powershell
.\svc.cmd install
.\svc.cmd start
```

## Verify Installation

Verify the runner is registered:

1. Go to your GitHub repository/organization
2. Navigate to **Settings > Actions > Runners**
3. Verify your runner appears in the list
4. Check runner status (should be "online")

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive runner names
- Label runners appropriately (e.g., `self-hosted`, `linux`, `docker`)
- Run runners as services for reliability
- Monitor runner logs for issues
- Keep runners updated to the latest version
- Use separate runners for different environments

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Runner not connecting**: Check GitHub URL and token
- **Service not starting**: Check service logs and permissions
- **Network errors**: Verify connectivity to GitHub
- **Permission errors**: Verify runner has necessary permissions
