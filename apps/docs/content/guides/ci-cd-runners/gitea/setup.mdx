Learn how to set up Gitea Actions with CI/CD Runners.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Gitea Actions with CI/CD Runners:

- Gitea instance (version 1.19+ required for Actions)
- Actions enabled in Gitea configuration
- CI/CD Runners infrastructure configured
- Access to Gitea instance for runner registration

## Enable Gitea Actions

Enable Actions in your Gitea configuration file (`app.ini`):

```ini
[actions]
ENABLED = true
```

Restart Gitea for changes to take effect.

## Install Gitea Actions Runner

Download and install the Gitea Actions Runner:

### Linux

```bash
# Download the runner
curl -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -o actions-runner.tar.gz

# Extract
tar xzf actions-runner.tar.gz

# Configure
./config.sh --url https://gitea.example.com --token YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN
```

### macOS

```bash
# Download the runner
curl -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -o actions-runner.tar.gz

# Extract
tar xzf actions-runner.tar.gz

# Configure
./config.sh --url https://gitea.example.com --token YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN
```

### Windows

1. Download the runner from the Gitea Actions releases page
2. Extract the archive
3. Run `config.cmd` with your Gitea URL and token

## Configure Runner

Run the configuration script:

```bash
./config.sh --url https://gitea.example.com --token YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Gitea instance URL
2. Runner name
3. Labels (optional)
4. Work folder (optional)

## Start Runner

Start the runner as a service:

### Linux (systemd)

```bash
# Install service
sudo ./svc.sh install

# Start service
sudo ./svc.sh start

# Check status
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

### macOS (launchd)

```bash
# Install service
./svc.sh install

# Start service
./svc.sh start
```

### Windows (NSSM)

```powershell
# Install service
.\svc.cmd install

# Start service
.\svc.cmd start
```

## Verify Installation

Verify the runner is registered and running:

1. Go to your Gitea instance
2. Navigate to **Settings > Actions > Runners**
3. Verify your runner appears in the list
4. Check runner status (should be "online")

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive runner names
- Label runners appropriately
- Run runners as services for reliability
- Monitor runner logs for issues
- Keep runners updated
- Use dedicated runners for sensitive projects

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Actions not enabled**: Verify Actions are enabled in Gitea config
- **Runner not connecting**: Check Gitea URL and token
- **Service not starting**: Check service logs and permissions
- **Network errors**: Verify connectivity to Gitea instance
