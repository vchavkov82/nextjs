Create Gitea Actions workflows using CI/CD Runners.

## Overview

Gitea Actions workflows use the same syntax as GitHub Actions, making it easy to migrate existing workflows or create new ones.

## Basic Workflow

Create a `.gitea/workflows/ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build
        run: echo "Building application"
      - name: Test
        run: echo "Running tests"
```

## Using Specific Runners

Target specific runners using labels:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, docker]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker build -t myapp .
```

## Matrix Builds

Run jobs across multiple configurations:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

## Caching

Cache dependencies for faster builds:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

## Artifacts

Upload and download artifacts:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: ./build.sh
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist/

  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Environment Variables

Use environment variables:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production
      BUILD_VERSION: ${{ github.sha }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building version $BUILD_VERSION"
```

## Secrets

Use secrets securely:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Conditional Execution

Run steps conditionally:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Best Practices

- Use self-hosted runners for consistency
- Label runners appropriately
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Use artifacts to share build outputs
- Store secrets in Gitea secrets management
- Use conditional execution for efficiency
- Document workflow purpose and requirements

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Workflows not running**: Check Actions are enabled and workflow syntax is correct
- **Runner not found**: Verify runner labels match workflow requirements
- **Cache not working**: Check cache keys and paths
- **Artifacts missing**: Verify artifact paths and permissions
