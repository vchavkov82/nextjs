- **GitLab Runner Integration**: Register runners with GitLab instances
- **Scalable Runners**: Scale runners based on workload demands
- **Multiple Executors**: Support for Docker, Kubernetes, and shell executors
- **Caching Strategies**: Optimized caching for GitLab CI/CD jobs
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Linux, Windows, and macOS runners
- **Security**: Secure runner registration and job execution

## Benefits

Using CI/CD Runners with GitLab CI/CD provides:

- **Cost savings**: More cost-effective than GitLab.com shared runners
- **Performance**: Customizable compute resources for faster builds
- **Control**: Full control over runner environment and dependencies
- **Scalability**: Scale runners based on project needs
- **Privacy**: Keep sensitive builds on your own infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Support for custom images and configurations

## Quick Start

Get started with GitLab CI/CD on CI/CD Runners:

1. [Install and configure GitLab Runner](/guides/ci-cd-runners/gitlab/setup) on your infrastructure
2. [Register runners with GitLab](/guides/ci-cd-runners/gitlab/runner-registration) instance
3. [Configure GitLab CI/CD pipelines](/guides/ci-cd-runners/gitlab/pipelines) to use your runners

## Use Cases

CI/CD Runners with GitLab CI/CD are ideal for:

- Self-hosted GitLab instances requiring dedicated runners
- Projects with specific dependencies or requirements
- Large teams with high CI/CD workload
- Sensitive projects requiring private infrastructure
- Cost optimization for high-volume CI/CD usage
- Custom build environments and configurations

## Runner Types

CI/CD Runners support various GitLab Runner executors:

- **Docker**: Run jobs in Docker containers
- **Kubernetes**: Execute jobs on Kubernetes clusters
- **Shell**: Direct execution on runner host
- **Docker Machine**: Auto-scaling Docker runners
