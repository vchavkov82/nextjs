Learn how to set up GitLab Runner with CI/CD Runners infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up GitLab Runner:

- GitLab instance (self-hosted or GitLab.com)
- CI/CD Runners infrastructure configured
- Docker installed (for Docker executor)
- Access to GitLab instance for runner registration

## Installation

Install GitLab Runner on Linux:

```bash
# Download the binary
curl -L "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh" | sudo bash

# Install GitLab Runner
sudo apt-get install gitlab-runner
```

Install GitLab Runner on macOS:

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install gitlab-runner

# Start the service
brew services start gitlab-runner
```

Install GitLab Runner on Windows:

1. Download the GitLab Runner binary
2. Create a GitLab Runner directory (e.g., `C:\GitLab-Runner`)
3. Extract the binary to the directory
4. Run as a service using NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)

## Configuration

GitLab Runner configuration is stored in `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml` (Linux) or `~/.gitlab-runner/config.toml` (macOS/Windows).

### Basic Configuration

Example configuration file:

```toml
concurrent = 4
check_interval = 0

[session_server]
  session_timeout = 1800

[[runners]]
  name = "ci-cd-runner"
  url = "https://gitlab.com/"
  token = "your-runner-token"
  executor = "docker"
  [runners.docker]
    tls_verify = false
    image = "alpine:latest"
    privileged = false
    disable_entrypoint_overwrite = false
    oom_kill_disable = false
    disable_cache = false
    volumes = ["/cache"]
    shm_size = 0
```

## Docker Executor

Configure Docker executor:

```toml
[[runners]]
  executor = "docker"
  [runners.docker]
    image = "docker:latest"
    privileged = true
    volumes = ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock", "/cache"]
```

## Kubernetes Executor

Configure Kubernetes executor:

```toml
[[runners]]
  executor = "kubernetes"
  [runners.kubernetes]
    namespace = "gitlab-runner"
    image = "alpine:latest"
```

## Shell Executor

Configure shell executor:

```toml
[[runners]]
  executor = "shell"
  environment = ["PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"]
```

## Best Practices

- Use Docker executor for isolation
- Configure appropriate concurrent job limits
- Set up caching for faster builds
- Use tagged runners for specific job types
- Monitor runner performance and resource usage
- Keep GitLab Runner updated

## Verification

Verify GitLab Runner is running:

```bash
# Check runner status
gitlab-runner status

# List registered runners
gitlab-runner list

# Verify runner connectivity
gitlab-runner verify
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Runner not connecting**: Check GitLab URL and token
- **Docker executor issues**: Verify Docker is running and accessible
- **Permission errors**: Check runner user permissions
- **Network issues**: Verify network connectivity to GitLab instance
