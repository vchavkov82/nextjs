Overview of using CI/CD Runners with Bazel builds.

## Overview

CI/CD Runners provide optimized support for Bazel builds with remote caching and remote execution, significantly speeding up your Bazel builds and tests.

## Features

CI/CD Runners support for Bazel includes:

- **Remote Caching**: Share build artifacts across builds and team members
- **Remote Execution**: Execute builds on remote infrastructure
- **Build Insights**: Get visibility into build performance and dependencies
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub Actions and other CI/CD platforms
- **Build UI**: Visualize and debug your Bazel builds

## Benefits

Using CI/CD Runners with Bazel provides:

- **Faster builds**: 10-100x speedup with remote caching and execution
- **Cost savings**: More cost-effective than running builds locally
- **Team collaboration**: Share cache and execution results across team
- **Scalability**: Handle large builds and test suites
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent build environments

## Quick Start

Get started with Bazel on CI/CD Runners:

1. [Set up remote caching](/guides/ci-cd-runners/bazel/remote-cache) for faster builds
2. [Configure remote execution](/guides/ci-cd-runners/bazel/remote-execution) for parallel builds
3. [Integrate with GitHub Actions](/guides/ci-cd-runners/bazel/github-actions) for CI/CD workflows

## Use Cases

CI/CD Runners with Bazel are ideal for:

- Large monorepos with many dependencies
- Multi-language projects (Java, C++, Python, Go, etc.)
- Teams requiring fast, consistent builds
- Projects with extensive test suites
- Builds requiring specialized compute resources
