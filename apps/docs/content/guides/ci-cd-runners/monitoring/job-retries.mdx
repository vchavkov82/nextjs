title: 'Job Retries'
---

Jobs processed with CI/CD Runners are regularly inspected to ensure they were able to get a runner assigned, as well as detect idle runners and remove them.

## Overview

Job retries automatically handle job failures and ensure jobs are properly executed.

## Automatic Retries

CI/CD Runners automatically retries:

- Jobs that fail due to runner issues
- Jobs that timeout
- Jobs that fail due to infrastructure problems

## Configuration

Configure retry behavior:

```yaml
monitoring:
  job_retries:
    enabled: true
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_strategy: exponential
    retry_on:
      - runner_unavailable
      - infrastructure_error
```

## Retry Strategies

Retry strategies include:

- **Fixed delay**: Constant delay between retries
- **Exponential backoff**: Increasing delays
- **Custom backoff**: Custom retry logic

## Monitoring

Monitor retry metrics:

- **Retry rate**: Percentage of jobs retried
- **Retry success rate**: Success rate after retries
- **Retry causes**: Reasons for retries

## Best Practices

- Set appropriate retry limits
- Use exponential backoff
- Monitor retry rates
- Investigate high retry rates
- Optimize to reduce retries
