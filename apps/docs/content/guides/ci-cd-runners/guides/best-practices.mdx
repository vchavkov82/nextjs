Best practices for running CI/CD Runners effectively and efficiently.

## Resource Sizing

- **Right-size instances**: Match instance types to your workload requirements
- **Use spot instances**: Save costs on non-critical workloads
- **Monitor utilization**: Adjust sizing based on actual usage patterns

## Caching

- **Enable caching**: Use caching strategies to speed up builds
- **Cache dependencies**: Cache package managers and build tools
- **Use appropriate cache backends**: Choose cache backend based on workload

## Security

- **Least privilege**: Use minimal IAM permissions
- **Network isolation**: Use private subnets and security groups
- **Regular updates**: Keep runner images and dependencies updated
- **Secrets management**: Use secure secret storage and rotation

## Cost Optimization

- **Use warm pools**: Reduce cold start times
- **Right-size instances**: Avoid over-provisioning
- **Monitor costs**: Track and optimize spending
- **Use spot instances**: For non-critical workloads
- **Leverage caching**: Reduce build times and compute costs
- **Optimize build steps**: Minimize unnecessary work

## Monitoring

- **Set up alerts**: Monitor runner health and job failures
- **Track metrics**: Monitor performance and utilization
- **Review logs**: Regularly review logs for issues
- **Cost reporting**: Track and optimize costs

## Job Configuration

- **Optimize job steps**: Minimize job execution time
- **Use matrix builds**: Efficiently test multiple configurations
- **Set appropriate timeouts**: Prevent runaway jobs
- **Use job labels**: Route jobs to appropriate runners

## Scaling

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more runners for increased capacity
- **Vertical scaling**: Use larger instances for heavy workloads
- **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling based on queue depth
- **Warm pools**: Keep runners ready for faster job starts

## Networking

- **Use VPCs**: Isolate runners in private networks
- **Static IPs**: Use static IPs for whitelisting if needed
- **Network security**: Implement proper security groups and NACLs
