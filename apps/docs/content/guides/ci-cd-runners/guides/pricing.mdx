## What's Included in All Plans

Regardless of plan tier:

- **Multi-platform builds:** Support for x86, ARM, and all platforms
- **Unlimited concurrency:** Run as many builds as you want simultaneously
- **Persistent layer caching:** Automatic shared cache across team
- **BuildKit optimizations:** Latest BuildKit features
- **mTLS security:** Encrypted builder connections
- **API tokens & OIDC:** Multiple authentication methods
- **Depot Registry:** Docker image registry included
- **Build analytics:** View build history and metrics

## Build Minutes

Build minutes are calculated as:

```
Build Minutes = Duration (minutes) × Number of Platforms
```

### Examples

**Single platform build:**
- 5 minute build × 1 platform = 5 build minutes

**Multi-platform build:**
- 5 minute build × 2 platforms (amd64 + arm64) = 10 build minutes
- 5 minute build × 4 platforms = 20 build minutes

**Parallel builds:**
- Each concurrent build counts separately
- 2 × 5 minute builds = 10 build minutes total

## Cache Storage

### Included Storage

Each plan includes default cache storage:

- **Developer:** 25GB
- **Startup:** 250GB
- **Business:** Custom

### Additional Storage

Additional cache storage available:

- **$0.20/GB/month** for Startup and Business plans
- Scales automatically with usage
- No upfront commitment

### Storage Reduction

Reduce storage costs by:

1. **Optimizing images:** Multi-stage builds reduce final size
2. **Aggressive pruning:** Remove unused layers and bases
3. **Layer deduplication:** Share common base layers
4. **Retention policies:** Auto-delete old cached layers

## Estimating Costs

### Small Project (Startup)

- 50 builds/month × 3 minutes = 150 minutes
- 50 multi-platform (amd64 + arm64) = 150 minutes
- **Total: 300 build minutes/month** (well under 5,000)
- **Cost:** $200/month base

### Medium Project (Startup)

- 200 builds/month × 5 minutes = 1,000 minutes
- 50% single platform, 50% multi-platform average = 750 build minutes
- **Total: 1,250 build minutes/month**
- **Cost:** $200/month base

### Large Project (Startup with Overages)

- 500 builds/month × 10 minutes = 5,000 minutes
- All multi-platform (amd64 + arm64, arm/v7) = 15,000 build minutes
- **Exceeds 5,000:** 10,000 overage × $0.04 = $400
- **Cost:** $200 base + $400 overage = $600/month

## FAQ

### Can I exceed my build minutes?

Yes, overage minutes are available at the standard rate for your plan ($0.04/minute for Startup and Business).

### What happens if I exceed my monthly allocation?

Builds will continue to run with overage charges applied automatically. You can set spending limits in your account settings.

### Can I upgrade/downgrade plans?

Yes, you can change plans anytime. Changes take effect at the next billing cycle. Pro-rata adjustments apply.

### Is there a discount for annual billing?

Contact sales for volume discounts and annual payment options.

### Do I pay for cached builds?

Yes, cached builds consume build minutes, but typically complete much faster (reducing overall costs).

### What's included in the Depot Registry?

The Depot Registry provides:

- Unlimited private repositories
- Registry integration with Container Builds
- Image pull via standard Docker commands
- Automatic cleanup policies

### Can I use my own registry?

Yes, Container Builds works with any Docker-compatible registry:

- Docker Hub
- Amazon ECR
- Azure Container Registry
- GitHub Container Registry
- GitLab Container Registry
- And others

You can push images anywhere using standard Docker authentication.

### Is there a free trial?

## Cost Optimization

### Strategies to Reduce Costs

1. **Optimize build times:** Faster builds = fewer minutes
2. **Multi-stage builds:** Smaller final images
3. **Cache effectively:** Reduce redundant builds
4. **Group builds:** Batch smaller builds together
5. **Use appropriate tier:** Right-size your plan
6. **Monitor usage:** Track build metrics

### ROI

Container Builds typically pays for itself through:

- **Faster CI/CD:** 5-20x faster builds = faster deployments
- **Developer productivity:** Less waiting on builds
- **Infrastructure savings:** Offloaded from local machines
- **Team efficiency:** Shared caches eliminate duplication

Example: If your team spends 2 hours/day waiting on builds, that's 10 hours/week of lost productivity. At $50/hour average cost, that's $500/week or $2,000/month in lost productivity that Container Builds helps recover.
