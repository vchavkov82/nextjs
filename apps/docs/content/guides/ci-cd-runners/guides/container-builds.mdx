title: 'Container Builds'
---

Remote Docker image building that's up to 40x faster than local or CI provider builds.

## Overview

Container Builds provides remote Docker image building as a drop-in replacement for `docker build`. The service runs optimized BuildKit on remote builder infrastructure, eliminating the need to manage layer caches manually via tarballs.

### How It Works

When running a container build:

1. Build context is sent to remote builder instances running optimized BuildKit
2. The build executes on high-performance infrastructure (16 CPUs, 32GB RAM by default)
3. Image is returned to your machine or pushed to your registry
4. Layer cache is stored persistently in your project
5. Cache becomes immediately available to team members for subsequent builds

## Key Benefits

**Performance**: Eliminates manual layer cache management; uses fast NVMe SSD storage instead. Builds are 3-5x faster on first run, and 10-20x faster with layer caching.

**Multi-Platform Builds**: Build x86 and ARM images natively without emulation. Handles `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/ARM/v6`, `linux/ARM/v7`, and `linux/386`.

**Local Development**: Offloads resource-intensive builds, preserving local CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.

**Team Collaboration**: Share persistent caches across your team so everyone benefits from previously built layers automatically.

**CI Performance**: Improves CI pipeline speed without manual infrastructure management or tarballing caches.

## Builder Infrastructure

Default configuration:
- **16 CPUs** and **32GB RAM** per build (up to 64 CPUs/128GB on premium plans)
- **50GB NVMe SSD cache** (expandable to 500GB)
- Ephemeral EC2 instances automatically provisioned
- mTLS certificates securing all connections

## Security

Fork pull requests in open-source repositories run on **isolated builders without cache access**, preventing cache poisoning attacks. This ensures security while maintaining performance benefits.

## Supported Platforms

- `linux/amd64` (x86-64)
- `linux/arm64` (ARM 64-bit)
- `linux/arm/v7` (ARM 32-bit v7)
- `linux/arm/v6` (ARM 32-bit v6)
- `linux/386` (Intel 386)

## Quick Start

Basic usage:

```bash
# Install CLI (if not already installed)
curl https://cli.depot.dev/install.sh | sh

# Run a build
depot build -t myapp:latest .

# Multi-platform build
depot build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t myapp:latest .

# Push to registry
depot build -t myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:latest --push .
```
