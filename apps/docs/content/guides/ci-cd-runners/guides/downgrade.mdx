Learn how to downgrade CI/CD Runners to a previous version.

## When to Downgrade

You may need to downgrade if:

- The new version has compatibility issues
- Breaking changes affect your workflows
- Performance regressions are identified
- Critical bugs are discovered

## Downgrade Process

The downgrade process is similar to upgrading but in reverse:

1. Identify the target version
2. Update configuration to use the previous version
3. Apply the changes using your installation method
4. Verify runners are running the previous version

## Pre-Downgrade Considerations

Before downgrading:

- Review what features you'll lose
- Check if downgrade is supported
- Backup current configuration
- Plan for potential compatibility issues

## Post-Downgrade Verification

After downgrading:

- Verify all runners are functioning correctly
- Test critical workflows
- Check for any configuration issues
- Monitor for stability
