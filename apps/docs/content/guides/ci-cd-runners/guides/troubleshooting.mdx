Common issues and solutions when working with CI/CD Runners.

## Runner Not Connecting

If runners are not connecting to your CI/CD platform:

- Check network connectivity and firewall rules
- Verify authentication credentials
- Review runner logs for error messages
- Ensure runner registration tokens are valid

## Jobs Failing

If jobs are failing on runners:

- Check runner capacity and resources
- Review job logs for specific errors
- Verify required dependencies are installed
- Check disk space and memory usage

## Performance Issues

If runners are performing poorly:

- Review runner instance types and sizing
- Check caching configuration
- Verify network bandwidth
- Monitor resource utilization

## Common Errors

### Runner Timeout

Runners may timeout if jobs run too long. Consider:
- Increasing job timeout limits
- Using larger runner instances
- Optimizing job steps

### Out of Memory

If runners run out of memory:
- Use larger instance types
- Optimize job steps
- Use spot instances for cost-effective scaling
