Using CI/CD Runners with Go projects.

## Overview

CI/CD Runners provide optimized environments for Go builds and tests.

## Setup

Configure your CI/CD workflow for Go:

```yaml
name: Go CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
      - run: go test ./...
      - run: go build ./...
```

## Caching

Cache Go modules for faster builds:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/go-build
      ~/go/pkg/mod
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
```

## Best Practices

- Use Go module caching
- Test on multiple Go versions
- Use build tags for conditional compilation
- Optimize test execution time
