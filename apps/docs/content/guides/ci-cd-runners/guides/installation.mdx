Install Self-hosted CI/CD Runners to begin running your CI/CD workflows on your own infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Self-hosted CI/CD Runners, ensure you have:

- Access to cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Appropriate IAM permissions for creating and managing resources
- A GitHub repository or CI/CD platform account
- Basic knowledge of infrastructure-as-code tools

## Quick Start

The installation process typically involves:

1. Setting up the runner infrastructure
2. Configuring runner types and pools
3. Connecting to your CI/CD platform
4. Verifying runner connectivity
5. Setting up caching (optional but recommended)

## Installation Methods

Self-hosted CI/CD Runners can be installed using:

- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
- CLI tools
- Managed services
- GitHub Actions setup actions

## Performance Considerations

After installation, consider:

- **Enable caching**: Set up remote caching for faster builds
- **Use appropriate instance types**: Match instance size to workload
- **Configure warm pools**: Reduce job startup times
- **Monitor performance**: Track build times and optimize
