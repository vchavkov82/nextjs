title: 'YOLO mode (tmpfs)'
---

Use YOLO mode (tmpfs) for in-memory caching for maximum speed.

## Overview

YOLO mode uses tmpfs (in-memory filesystem) for caching, providing the fastest possible cache operations at the cost of volatility.

## How It Works

YOLO mode:

- Uses tmpfs for caching
- Provides extremely fast operations
- Loses cache on restart
- Best for temporary caches

## Setup

Enable YOLO mode in your configuration:

```yaml
caching:
  yolo_mode:
    enabled: true
    size: 10G
    mount_point: /tmp/cache
```

## Usage

Use YOLO mode for fast temporary caches:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Dependencies
    run: npm install --cache /tmp/cache/npm
  - name: Build
    run: npm run build
```

## Benefits

YOLO mode provides:

- **Maximum speed**: In-memory operations
- **Simple setup**: Easy to enable
- **Low overhead**: No persistent storage
- **Fast cleanup**: Automatic on restart

<Admonition type="warning">

YOLO mode caches are lost when the runner restarts. Use only for temporary caches that can be rebuilt quickly.

## Best Practices

- Use for fast temporary caches
- Don't rely on persistence
- Monitor memory usage
- Use appropriate cache sizes
