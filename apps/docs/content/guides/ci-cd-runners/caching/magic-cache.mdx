How to use CI/CD Runners Magic Cache to speed up your builds and get unlimited cache on CI/CD runners, by swapping the cache backend to S3.

## Overview

Magic Cache automatically swaps the cache backend to S3, providing unlimited cache storage and faster cache operations.

## How It Works

Magic Cache:

- Intercepts cache operations
- Stores caches in S3
- Provides unlimited storage
- Maintains compatibility with existing cache actions

## Setup

Enable Magic Cache in your configuration:

```yaml
caching:
  magic_cache:
    enabled: true
    bucket: my-cache-bucket
    region: us-east-1
```

## Benefits

Magic Cache provides:

- **Unlimited storage**: Store caches of any size
- **Faster operations**: Optimized S3 access
- **Cost effective**: Pay only for storage used
- **Compatible**: Works with existing cache actions

## Usage

Use Magic Cache with standard cache actions:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate cache keys
- Set cache expiration policies
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Clean up stale caches
