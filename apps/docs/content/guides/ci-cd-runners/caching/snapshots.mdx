title: 'Snapshots'
---

Save and restore entire folders with block-level snapshots. Helps to speed-up docker builds in your CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

Snapshots allow you to save and restore entire directories at the block level, providing fast restore times for Docker builds and other workflows.

## How It Works

Snapshots:

- Capture directory state at block level
- Store snapshots efficiently
- Restore directories quickly
- Support incremental snapshots

## Setup

Configure snapshots in your configuration:

```yaml
caching:
  snapshots:
    enabled: true
    storage_backend: s3
    bucket: my-snapshots-bucket
```

## Usage

Use snapshots in your workflows:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Restore Snapshot
    run: |
      snapshot restore my-snapshot
  - name: Build Docker Image
    run: docker build -t myapp .
  - name: Save Snapshot
    run: snapshot save my-snapshot
```

## Benefits

Snapshots provide:

- **Fast restore**: Block-level restore is fast
- **Efficient storage**: Incremental snapshots
- **Docker optimization**: Speed up Docker builds
- **Flexibility**: Use for any directory-based cache

## Best Practices

- Use for Docker layer caching
- Take snapshots after dependency installation
- Set snapshot retention policies
- Monitor snapshot sizes
