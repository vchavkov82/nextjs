Use Elastic File System (EFS) for shared filesystem caching across runners.

## Overview

Elastic File System provides a shared filesystem that can be mounted by multiple runners, enabling shared caching.

## How It Works

Elastic File System:

- Provides a shared filesystem
- Mounted by multiple runners
- Enables shared caches
- Provides persistent storage

## Setup

Configure EFS in your stack:

```yaml
caching:
  elastic_file_system:
    enabled: true
    file_system_id: fs-12345678
    mount_point: /mnt/efs/cache
```

## Usage

Use EFS-mounted directories for caching:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Restore Cache
    run: |
      if [ -d /mnt/efs/cache/npm ]; then
        cp -r /mnt/efs/cache/npm ~/.npm
      fi
  - name: Install Dependencies
    run: npm install
  - name: Save Cache
    run: cp -r ~/.npm /mnt/efs/cache/npm
```

## Benefits

Elastic File System provides:

- **Shared caching**: Share caches across runners
- **Persistent storage**: Survives runner restarts
- **Scalability**: Multiple runners can access
- **Performance**: Network-attached storage

## Best Practices

- Use for shared caches
- Monitor EFS performance
- Set appropriate performance mode
- Clean up stale caches
