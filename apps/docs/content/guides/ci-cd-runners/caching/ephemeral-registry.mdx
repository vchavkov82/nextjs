How to use the ephemeral registry with CI/CD Runners, for incredible build speeds.

## Overview

Ephemeral registry provides a fast, temporary Docker registry for building and caching Docker images.

## How It Works

Ephemeral registry:

- Creates a temporary registry per job
- Stores images in memory or fast storage
- Provides fast push/pull operations
- Automatically cleans up after jobs

## Setup

Enable ephemeral registry in your configuration:

```yaml
caching:
  ephemeral_registry:
    enabled: true
    storage_backend: memory
```

## Usage

Use ephemeral registry in your workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and Push
        run: |
          docker build -t registry.local/myapp:latest .
          docker push registry.local/myapp:latest
```

## Benefits

Ephemeral registry provides:

- **Fast operations**: Optimized for speed
- **Temporary storage**: Automatic cleanup
- **Compatibility**: Works with Docker workflows
- **Cost effective**: No persistent storage costs

## Best Practices

- Use for temporary builds
- Push to permanent registry if needed
- Monitor registry performance
- Clean up unused images
