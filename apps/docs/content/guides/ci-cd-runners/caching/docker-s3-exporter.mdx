title: 'Docker S3 Exporter'
---

Export Docker layers to S3 for caching and faster builds.

## Overview

Docker S3 Exporter allows you to export Docker layers to S3, providing efficient caching for Docker builds.

## How It Works

Docker S3 Exporter:

- Exports Docker layers to S3
- Imports layers from S3
- Caches layers efficiently
- Speeds up Docker builds

## Setup

Configure Docker S3 Exporter:

```yaml
caching:
  docker_s3_exporter:
    enabled: true
    bucket: my-docker-cache-bucket
    region: us-east-1
```

## Usage

Docker S3 Exporter works automatically with Docker builds:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - name: Build Docker Image
    run: docker build -t myapp .
```

## Benefits

Docker S3 Exporter provides:

- **Layer caching**: Cache Docker layers in S3
- **Faster builds**: Reuse cached layers
- **Cost effective**: Pay only for storage used
- **Scalability**: Share caches across runners

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate cache keys
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Set cache expiration policies
- Clean up unused layers
