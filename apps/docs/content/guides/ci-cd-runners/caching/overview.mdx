Overview of the different caching strategies available in CI/CD Runners, and how to use them.

## Caching Strategies

CI/CD Runners support multiple caching strategies to speed up builds and reduce costs:

- **Remote Cache**: Distributed caching for build tools (Bazel, Go, Gradle, Turborepo, sccache, Pants)
- **Magic Cache**: Automatic cache backend swapping to S3
- **Ephemeral Registry**: Fast ephemeral Docker registry
- **Snapshots**: Block-level snapshots for fast restore
- **Docker S3 Exporter**: Export Docker layers to S3
- **Elastic File System**: Shared filesystem for caching
- **YOLO mode (tmpfs)**: In-memory caching for speed

## Benefits

Caching provides:

- **Faster builds**: Reuse cached dependencies and artifacts
- **Cost savings**: Reduce build times and infrastructure costs
- **Scalability**: Share caches across runners
- **Flexibility**: Choose the right strategy for your workload

## Choosing a Strategy

Select a caching strategy based on:

- **Workload type**: Build systems, package managers, Docker builds
- **Cache size**: Small vs large caches
- **Performance requirements**: Speed vs cost tradeoffs
- **Infrastructure**: Available storage and networking

## Best Practices

- Enable caching for package managers
- Use appropriate cache backends
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Optimize cache keys
- Clean up stale caches
