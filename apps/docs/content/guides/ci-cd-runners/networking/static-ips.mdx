title: 'Static IPs'
---

Learn how CI/CD Runners can be configured with static IP addresses for CI/CD runners, ensuring secure, compliant, and reliable CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

Static IP addresses provide fixed IP addresses for runners, which is useful for whitelisting, compliance, and predictable networking.

## Configuration

Configure static IPs in your stack:

```yaml
networking:
  static_ips:
    enabled: true
    allocation_ids:
      - eipalloc-12345678
      - eipalloc-87654321
```

## Benefits

Static IPs provide:

- **Whitelisting**: Fixed IPs for allowlisting
- **Compliance**: Meet IP-based requirements
- **Reliability**: Predictable networking
- **Security**: Control outbound connections

## Use Cases

Static IPs are useful for:

- **Whitelisting**: Allowlist runner IPs in external systems
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements
- **Firewalls**: Configure firewall rules
- **Monitoring**: Track runner traffic by IP

## Best Practices

- Use Elastic IPs for cost-effective static IPs
- Monitor IP usage
- Document IP assignments
- Use IP whitelisting only when necessary
