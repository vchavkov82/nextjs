Overview of networking options in CI/CD Runners - VPC configuration, static IPs, SSH access, and more.

## Networking Options

CI/CD Runners support various networking configurations:

- **VPC Configuration**: Use existing VPCs or create new ones
- **Static IPs**: Assign static IP addresses to runners
- **SSH/SSM Access**: Secure access to runners for debugging
- **Security Groups**: Configure network security

## Quick Start

1. [Configure VPC](/guides/ci-cd-runners/networking/reuse-existing-vpc) for network isolation
2. [Set up SSH/SSM access](/guides/ci-cd-runners/networking/ssh-ssm-access) for debugging
3. [Configure static IPs](/guides/ci-cd-runners/networking/static-ips) if needed

## Common Configurations

- **Private Subnets**: Isolate runners in private networks
- **Security Groups**: Control network access
- **NAT Gateways**: Enable outbound internet access
- **VPC Peering**: Connect to other VPCs

## Best Practices

- Use private subnets for security
- Apply least privilege security groups
- Use static IPs for whitelisting if needed
- Enable SSH/SSM access for debugging
