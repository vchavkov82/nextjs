title: 'SSH / SSM Access'
---

CI/CD Runners provides a dedicated SSH / SSM console to access your CI/CD runners, for easy troubleshooting.

## Overview

SSH and SSM access allow you to securely connect to runners for debugging, troubleshooting, and manual intervention.

## SSH Access

Configure SSH access:

```yaml
networking:
  ssh:
    enabled: true
    key_pair: my-key-pair
    allowed_cidrs:
      - 10.0.0.0/8
```

## SSM Access

Configure SSM access (AWS):

```yaml
networking:
  ssm:
    enabled: true
    instance_profile: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/runners-ssm
```

## Usage

### SSH

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@runner-ip
```

### SSM

```bash
aws ssm start-session --target i-1234567890abcdef0
```

## Security

SSH and SSM access should be:

- Restricted to necessary IP ranges
- Used only for troubleshooting
- Disabled in production if not needed
- Monitored and audited

## Best Practices

- Use SSM when possible (no key management)
- Restrict access to necessary IPs
- Use SSH keys securely
- Enable audit logging
- Disable access when not needed
