title: 'Reuse Existing VPC'
---

CI/CD Runners can be configured to reuse an existing VPC, to avoid creating a new one.

## Overview

Reusing an existing VPC allows you to integrate CI/CD Runners into your existing network infrastructure.

## Configuration

Configure runners to use an existing VPC:

```yaml
networking:
  vpc:
    vpc_id: vpc-12345678
    subnet_ids:
      - subnet-12345678
      - subnet-87654321
    security_group_ids:
      - sg-12345678
```

## Benefits

Reusing an existing VPC provides:

- **Integration**: Work with existing infrastructure
- **Network isolation**: Use existing network policies
- **Cost savings**: Avoid creating duplicate resources
- **Simplicity**: Single VPC to manage

## Requirements

When reusing a VPC, ensure:

- Subnets have appropriate route tables
- Security groups allow necessary traffic
- NAT gateways exist for outbound access (if needed)
- DNS resolution is configured

## Best Practices

- Use private subnets for runners
- Configure appropriate security groups
- Enable VPC flow logs for monitoring
- Document network architecture
