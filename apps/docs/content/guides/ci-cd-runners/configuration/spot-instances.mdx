Learn how to use spot instances with CI/CD Runners for cost savings.

## Overview

Spot instances allow you to use spare cloud capacity at significantly reduced prices, providing substantial cost savings for CI/CD workloads.

## Benefits

Spot instances provide:

- **Cost savings**: Up to 90% discount compared to on-demand
- **Scalability**: Access to additional capacity
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for fault-tolerant workloads

## Configuration

Enable spot instances in your configuration:

```yaml
runners:
  - name: spot
    spot_enabled: true
    spot_max_price: "0.10"
    on_demand_fallback: true
```

## Best Practices

- Use spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- Enable on-demand fallback for critical jobs
- Set appropriate max prices
- Handle spot interruptions gracefully
- Use spot instances with warm pools

<Admonition type="note">

Spot instances can be interrupted. Ensure your jobs can handle interruptions or use on-demand fallback for critical jobs.
