title: 'Custom Images'
---

CI/CD Runners provides compatible images with official CI/CD runners, but you can also bring your own images if you want!

## Overview

Custom images allow you to use pre-configured images with your tools, dependencies, and configurations already installed.

## Benefits

Custom images provide:

- **Faster job startup**: Pre-installed dependencies
- **Consistency**: Same environment across jobs
- **Customization**: Install specific tools and versions
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent builds

## Building Custom Images

Build custom images using Docker or Packer:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    curl \
    build-essential

# Install custom tools
RUN curl -fsSL https://example.com/tool | bash
```

## Using Custom Images

Configure runners to use custom images:

```yaml
runners:
  - name: custom
    image: my-registry/custom-runner:latest
    labels:
      - linux
      - custom
```

## Best Practices

- Keep images minimal
- Use multi-stage builds
- Tag images with versions
- Regularly update base images
- Test images before using in production
