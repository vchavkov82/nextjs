title: 'Job Labels'
---

Learn how to configure your CI/CD runners with specific requirements in terms of CPU, GPU, RAM, volume size, and more.

## Overview

Job labels allow you to route jobs to specific runners based on requirements like CPU, GPU, RAM, and other specifications.

## Label Format

Job labels use a simple format:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, cpu-4, ram-8gb]
```

## Common Labels

- **OS**: `linux`, `windows`, `macos`
- **CPU**: `cpu-2`, `cpu-4`, `cpu-8`, `cpu-16`
- **RAM**: `ram-4gb`, `ram-8gb`, `ram-16gb`, `ram-32gb`
- **GPU**: `gpu`, `gpu-nvidia`, `gpu-amd`
- **Architecture**: `x64`, `arm64`

## Examples

### CPU Requirements

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, cpu-4, ram-8gb]
```

### GPU Requirements

```yaml
jobs:
  train:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, gpu-nvidia]
```

### Multiple Requirements

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, cpu-8, ram-16gb, x64]
```

## Best Practices

- Use specific labels to match job requirements
- Avoid over-specifying labels
- Use labels consistently across workflows
- Document label meanings for your team
