Learn how to tag CI/CD Runners resources with custom tags, as well as the default tags that are applied.

## Overview

Resource tags allow you to organize, track, and manage CI/CD Runners resources in your cloud environment.

## Default Tags

CI/CD Runners automatically applies default tags:

- **ManagedBy**: `ci-cd-runners`
- **RunnerId**: Unique runner identifier
- **StackName**: Stack name
- **Environment**: Environment name (if applicable)

## Custom Tags

Add custom tags to resources:

```yaml
tags:
  Project: my-project
  Team: engineering
  CostCenter: infrastructure
  Environment: production
```

## Using Tags

Tags can be used for:

- **Cost tracking**: Track costs by tag
- **Resource organization**: Group related resources
- **Automation**: Trigger actions based on tags
- **Compliance**: Meet tagging requirements

## Best Practices

- Use consistent tagging conventions
- Tag all resources
- Use tags for cost allocation
