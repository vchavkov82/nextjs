Overview of configuration options in CI/CD Runners - job labels, stack settings, custom images, and more.

## Configuration Options

CI/CD Runners can be configured through:

- **Job labels**: Route jobs to specific runners
- **Repository configuration**: Per-repository settings
- **Stack configuration**: Infrastructure and stack settings
- **Environments**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Custom images**: Custom runner images
- **Resource tags**: Tag resources for organization
- **Spot instances**: Use spot instances for cost savings

## Quick Start

1. [Configure job labels](/guides/ci-cd-runners/configuration/job-labels) to route jobs
2. [Set up repository configuration](/guides/ci-cd-runners/configuration/repository-configuration) for per-repo settings
3. [Configure stack settings](/guides/ci-cd-runners/configuration/stack-configuration) for infrastructure
4. [Set up environments](/guides/ci-cd-runners/configuration/environments) for isolation

## Common Configurations

- **Job Labels**: Match jobs to runners based on labels
- **Environments**: Isolate different workflows in different environments
- **Custom Images**: Use custom images with pre-installed tools
- **Resource Tags**: Organize and track resources
- **Spot Instances**: Save costs with spot instances

## Best Practices

- Use job labels for efficient job routing
- Separate environments for production and development
- Use custom images for consistent environments
- Tag resources for better organization
- Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
