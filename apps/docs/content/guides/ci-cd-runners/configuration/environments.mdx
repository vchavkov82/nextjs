Learn how to use CI/CD Runners environments to isolate different workflows in different environments, with different IAM permissions or stack configurations, etc.

## Overview

Environments allow you to isolate different workflows in different environments with separate configurations, permissions, and infrastructure.

## Benefits

Environments provide:

- **Isolation**: Separate workflows in different environments
- **Security**: Different IAM permissions per environment
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings
- **Cost tracking**: Track costs per environment

## Setup

Configure environments in your stack:

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    iam_role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/runners-prod
    min_runners: 2
    max_runners: 10
  development:
    iam_role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/runners-dev
    min_runners: 1
    max_runners: 5
```

## Using Environments

Reference environments in your workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Best Practices

- Use separate environments for production and development
- Apply least privilege IAM permissions
- Monitor costs per environment
- Use environment-specific configurations
