When Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) or physical backups are enabled, BA no longer generates the downloadable logical backup file (backup.gz). This is expected, as the backup pipeline switches entirely to physical backups. You can still download backups via the BA CLI command `pgdump`.

For step-by-step instructions, check out our guide: [Backup & Restore](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore).

You can also learn more about how backups work in BA here: [Database Backups](/docs/guides/platform/backups).
