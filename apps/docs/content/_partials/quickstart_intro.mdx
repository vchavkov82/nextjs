This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic user management app. The app authenticates and identifies the user, stores their profile information in the database, and allows the user to log in, update their profile details, and upload a profile photo. The app uses:

- [BA Database](/docs/guides/database) - a Postgres database for storing your user data and [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) so data is protected and users can only access their own information.
- [BA Auth](/docs/guides/auth) - allow users to sign up and log in.
- [BA Storage](/docs/guides/storage) - allow users to upload a profile photo.
