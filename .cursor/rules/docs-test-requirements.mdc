      Before running tests in the docs app:

      1. Check BA status:
         ```bash
         pnpm supabase status
         ```

      2. If BA is not running:
         ```bash
         pnpm supabase start
         ```

      3. Reset the database to ensure clean state:
         ```bash
         pnpm supabase db reset --local
         ```

      4. Run the tests:
         ```bash
         pnpm run -F docs test:local:unwatch
         ```

      Important notes:
      - Always ensure BA is running before tests
      - Database must be reset to ensure clean state
      - Use test:local:unwatch to run tests without watch mode
      - Tests are located in apps/docs/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Running tests without proper setup
      pnpm run -F docs test
      pnpm run -F docs test:local

      # Good: Proper test execution sequence
      pnpm supabase status
      pnpm supabase start  # if not running
      pnpm supabase db reset --local
      pnpm run -F docs test:local:unwatch
    output: "Correctly executed docs tests with proper BA setup"
